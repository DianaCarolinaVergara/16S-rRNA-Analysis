# 16S-rRNA-Analysis

With this pipeline we can develop a full 16S rRNA analysis with Qiime2 (2019.7) (I always worked with hipervariable regions V3-V4) for microbial characterization. After that, with some of these results you can perform the phylosimbiotic and cophylogenetic analysis (for Phylosymbiosis and Co-evolution models).
You will learn to:

1. Decompress your files and Import your sequences in Qiime2.
2. Demultiplex
3. Quality Filter analysis with DADA2.
4. Features table construction (OTUs table).
5. Alpha-rarefaction plotting
6. Alpha-Beta diversity Analysis
7. Taxonomic classification
8. Construct a phylogeny
9. Clssifiers (Random Forest)
10. Export final-files
